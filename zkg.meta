summary = Log data schema generation
description = This package generates schemas for Zeek's logs.
    For every log your Zeek installation produces, the schema describes each log
    field including name, type, docstring, and more. The package supports JSON Schema,
    CSV, a Zeek log to capture schema information, and a custom JSON representation.
    It understands Zeek's log customization in detail. The schema export code is
    extensible, allowing you to produce your own schemas.
